# Open Project: Exploratory Research in Vision-Language Models

## 1. How to Select a Topic
* **The topic should be on vision-language models and their applications in medical imaging.**
* **Question First:** Do not start by trying to improve the accuracy or performance for some task, this should not be your goal. Start with a specific question, for example, about a method, model behavior, or data subset. It can, however, be that the question is if a specific method is better than another for a specific task (i.e. "Does method X outperform method Y?").
* **Hypothesis-Driven:** Formulate a clear hypothesis that can be examined. Note that a negative result is perfectly acceptable if the work is executed correctly.
* **Most Important:** Select a topic that interests you and that you will learn from. 
* **Discuss the topic with the course instructors and teaching assistants for initial feedback.**

## 2. Example Research Themes
⚠️ *This is by no means an exhaustive list. Use if for inspiration only.*

* **Model Comparison:** How does the performance of different VLM architectures compare on medical tasks?
* **Prompt Sensitivity:** How does using different medical terminologies (e.g., "neoplasm" vs. "tumor") affect zero-shot classification accuracy?
* **Data Efficiency:** How does the performance of a linear probe degrade as training samples decrease?
* **Concept Alignment:** Does the model encode structural features (e.g., "high magnification") more effectively than pathological features (e.g., "malignancy")?

## 3. Technical Constraints
* **Dataset:** You are free to again use the [Open-MELON-VL-2.5K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MartiHan/Open-MELON-VL-2.5K) dataset. However you can also chose to use another public dataset.
* **Feasibility:** Make sure that the work is feasible given the time and compute constraints. This is very important in a project.

## 4. Deliverables

### A. The Pitch (Week 6)
* **Format:** Single slide presentation.
* **Style:** **You must use the [TU/e house style](https://studiegids.tue.nl/praktische-zaken/tue-huisstijl).**
* **Content:** clearly defined research question, baseline, metrics, and feasibility.
* **Goal:** Obtain feedback before proceeding with the main work.
* **Submission:** Upload via Canvas.

### B. Scientific Poster (End of Quartile)
* **Format:** Digital scientific poster.
* **Style:** **You must use the [TU/e house style](https://studiegids.tue.nl/praktische-zaken/tue-huisstijl)**  (A1 size using the specified font sizes, PDF format).
* **Content:** Abstract, Methodology, Results, and Critical Discussion. Any of the sections can be visualized using tables, charts, or images (when appropriate).
* **Submission:** Upload via Canvas as a PDF.
