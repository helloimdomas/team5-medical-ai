When writing markdown:

1. don't do bolded text
2. don't use italic text for anything but references
3. don't use weird symbols as "×" that don't come on a keyboard
4. don't use "-" to ephasize something in a sentence, just put a comma instead. Example: instead of "this shows that even with 3x more iterations, the lower learning rate cannot catch up to the default — the optimizer's small step size remains a bottleneck" write "this shows that even with 3x more iterations, the lower learning rate cannot catch up to the default (,) (and) (so) (anything else but the "-") the optimizer's small step size remains a bottleneck"
5. don't use words that are made up of multiple smaller words joined by "-" for example instead "multi-task learning" , use "multitask learning"
